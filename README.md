# PWCTestAPI
Web API Test for PWC
Updated on 23/02/2023 by Ray Wang:

Attached is the PWCTestAPI project.

I have created this as an ASP.NET 6 Web API project.

I have created a model "Client", then created a controller "ClientController".

I have created a local db context which has been used in the controllers to handle GET/POST/PUT/DELETE (CRUD) operations. (comments for adding the dummy connection string is in appsettings.json)

I have used swagger page to add the records for "Client" for a quick test.
